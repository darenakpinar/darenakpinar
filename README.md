👋 Hey, I’m Daren!

- 🎮 I got into coding in high school because of my love for gaming and everything visual.  
- 🚀 My first ever project? A simple game built with C# & Unity. That was my “ah-ha!” moment.
- 🧑‍💻 My coding teacher started his own business and had to stop our lessons. I took a break from coding… but the itch never left.
- 🔙 Fast forward to my final year of high school: instead of just grinding for the university entrance exam, I was coding again—and for the first time, I felt *real* ambition about my future.
- 🌍 I didn’t settle for a regular uni in Turkey. I chose to level up—so I focused on improving my English and tech skills for a year, then got accepted to Ca’ Foscari University in Venice for Computer Science & Data Science (CP|DS).
- 🎯 Now, I’m building my skills, chasing projects, and looking for new ways to blend creativity with tech.

Always down to collaborate or chat about coding, data, or tech life!
